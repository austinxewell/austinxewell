# Hi, I'm Austin 👋

I’m a **Front-End Engineer** focused on building **scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications**. I specialize in **Nuxt, TypeScript, Vue, and modern front-end architectures**, and I enjoy translating complex design and product requirements into seamless user experiences.

I’ve led projects ranging from **internal applications supporting 300+ daily users** to personal projects like **Git-N-Shape**, a fitness tracker, and **adoptABLE**, a domestic violence support platform. My work spans the full front-end stack, including responsive design, state management, and integrations with back-end services, always with a focus on **performance, accessibility, and developer efficiency**.

I also maintain a **dev blog** where I document milestones, experiments, and insights outside of GitHub: [https://austinxewell.github.io/my-dev-blog/](https://austinxewell.github.io/my-dev-blog/)

Colleagues describe me as **adaptable, proactive, and solution-oriented**, with a strong commitment to delivering high-quality applications while collaborating effectively across teams.
