# Hi, I'm Austin 👋

I’m a **Front-End Engineer** focused on building **scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications**. I specialize in **Nuxt, TypeScript, Vue, and modern front-end architectures**, and I enjoy translating complex design and product requirements into seamless user experiences.

Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:

- **Planning Poker** – A collaborative Agile estimation platform built with Nuxt 3 and TypeScript. Supports live voting and team-based planning rooms.  
- **Nuxt ESLint Automation Script** – A CLI tool that automates ESLint setup for Nuxt projects, streamlining code quality and developer workflow.  
- **Git-N-Shape** – A fitness tracking app that supports multiple users, team challenges, and shared data, showcasing collaborative features and team development.

I also maintain a **dev blog** where I document milestones, experiments, and insights outside of GitHub: [https://austinxewell.github.io/my-dev-blog/](https://austinxewell.github.io/my-dev-blog/)

Colleagues describe me as **adaptable, proactive, and solution-oriented**, with a strong commitment to delivering high-quality applications while collaborating effectively across teams.
