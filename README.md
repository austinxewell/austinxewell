### Hi, I'm Austin ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on front-end excellence. I earned my Full Stack Web Development certificate from the University of Utahâ€™s Coding Bootcamp, where I sharpened my skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, responsive design, and more. Iâ€™ve further expanded my expertise with specialized certifications in Vue, Vite, Nuxt, PHP, and TypeScript.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve led projectsâ€”from personal endeavors like Git-N-Shape and adoptABLE to professional applications used by 300+ daily usersâ€”where colleagues have recognized me as adaptable, motivated, and a proactive problem-solver. My contributions include key roles in building major HR management applications and integrated child applications that support company-wide operations.

I combine technical proficiency with a mobile-first design philosophy and a passion for collaboration, always striving to deliver balanced, high-quality solutions and build meaningful professional connections.
