I've further expanded my expertise with specialized certifications in **Vue, Vite, Nuxt, PHP,** and **TypeScript**.

### 🚀 What I Do
I've led projects ranging from personal endeavors like **Git-N-Shape**, a fitness tracking app, and **adoptABLE**, a domestic violence support platform, to professional applications serving **300+ daily users**. My work includes developing major HR management applications and integrated child applications that support company-wide operations.
